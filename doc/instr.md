Developer: # Role and Objective
- Develop a Python-based Lunar Lander game with design elements, features, and color palettes inspired by Cyberpunk 2077.

# Checklist
Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of sub-tasks to guide your development process.

# Instructions
- Build the core mechanics of a Lunar Lander game in Python.
- Integrate visual and thematic features reminiscent of Cyberpunk 2077, including neon colors, futuristic UI elements, and atmospheric effects.
- Ensure the game is playable and the cyberpunk theme is apparent in both visuals and audio (if applicable).

# Validation
After implementing the game, validate that it runs successfully and that the cyberpunk theme is clearly reflected in the aesthetics and mechanics. If validation fails, address the issues before delivery.

# Context
- Inspiration: Cyberpunk 2077 (for visual style, colors, and UI elements).
- Core gameplay: Lunar Lander (physics, controls, landing challenge).
- Out of scope: Multi-platform support, complex storylines, online multiplayer.

# Output Format
- Provide the full source code in a single Python file.
- Use comments to indicate sections for customization (colors, UI, features).

# Verbosity
- High: Include clear comments and descriptive variable names to aid readability and further customization.

# Stop Conditions
- Deliver when the game runs successfully and both Lunar Lander mechanics and Cyberpunk 2077-inspired aesthetics are clearly incorporated.
